syntax - find . -name filename - it will search the location for file/dir within the current dir
.-will seach in current dir
/- it will search in whole system
path(/home/ubuntu) - it will search in specific path
find . -iname filename - it will search location of file or dir irrespective of cases
find . -type f -iname filename - it will search for specific file
find . -type d -iname filename - it will search for specific dir 
find. -type f -mtime +90 -  it will display all the files which was modified 90 day ago
find . -type f -mtime -90 - it will display all the files which was modified within 90 days
find . -type f -mmin -10 - it will display all the files which was modified within 10 mins
find . -type f -mmin +10 - it will display all the files which was modified 10 mins ago
find . -type f -perm 077 -  it will display all the files with this permission  value
find . -type f - empty - it will display all the empty files
find . -type f -size +2M - used to display files which have size 2 mb

Question -- find the files which are modified 3 months ago and delete all the files
find . -type f -mtime +90 |xargs rm -rf

xargs- it is used to pass the output of one command  as sequence for next command

find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -iname f1 - it will restrict the file to search in current dir and in one sub dir
find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -iname f1 - it will restrict the file to search in current dir  and in level sub dir


awk is more powerful command. It can be used for multiple purpose such as displaying file content in column wise and row wise.
By default " " space will be considered as delimiter

Syntax:
awk -F " " '{print $3}' filename -it will print column 3 of file
awk -F " " '{print $3,$5}' filename - it will print the column 3 and 5
awk -F " " '{print $NF}' filename - it will print last column of file
awk -F " " '{print $(NF-1)}' filename  - it will print last but one column
awk -F " " '{print $(NF-2)}' filename - it will print last 2 column
awk -F " " '{print $0}' filename - full content of file
awk -F " " NR==3 '{print $2}' filename - it will print 2nd column from 3rd row
awk -F " " NR==3,NR==5 '{print $2}' filename - it will print 2nd column from line 3 to 5
awk -F " " NR==3||NR==5 '{print $2}' filename - it will print 2nd column from line 3 and line 5

Example1- need to set read write for user read write for group read write for others
777-666=111

777-644=133
umask 133
touch filename / mkdir dirname

	1. How do you check from how long system is up and running
	 uptime
	Using uptime we display load average for the past 1min,5min,15min
	
	2. How do you check remote servers are up and running
	ping server name or IP address
	
	3. How do you check which process is taking more cpu usage
	top or htop - whichever the process was displayed on 1st row. It will use more cpu usage
	
	
	4 . ps -process status
	It is a command used to check current process running on system in background
	
	ps -ef - print all the process with more detailed output
	
	ps  -e - print all the process within system 
	ps- print all the process of current user and terminal
	
	4. How do you check whether specific process running or not
	ps -ef | grep -i "process name"
	
	5. How do you list process started by specific user
	ps -u username
	ps -u ubuntu
	
	KILL - used to stop the process forcefully
	Kill -9  process id(pid)
	
	
	Gracefull stop 
	
	sudo systemctl stop servicename/processname - stop service
	
	sudo systemctl start service name/ processname - start service

netstat -lt -it will display tcp listening ports

How to check where all the ports are used or not?
netstat -atulnp 
-n indicates it will display active connections, address and port numbers are expressed numerical and no attempt is made to determine name
-p indicates to check protocols

How do you check whether specific port is used or not?
netstat - atulnp | grep "port number"

How do you run command/ script in the background
Using symbol & at the end of command
Ex: ls &

Nohup(no hang up) : while running script/ command. If execution is stopped due to network issue, once the network is back it will resumes the execution from where it was stopped
Syntax: nohup ls &

Link - it is shortcut of file
	1. Symbolic link(softlink) - it is ushortcut to a file. If we make any change in original file it will get reflected in link. If the file is deleted then link does not work
	Syntax: ln -s filename linkname
	
	2. Hardlink:it is shortcut to a file. If we delete original file, hardlink will  work because it points inode of file.
	Inode is memory address for the file
	
	Syntax: ln filename linkname
	
Password less connection
In server1 generate the ssh keys(private and public keys) copy the public key and goto server2 paste this public key in authorized_key file under .ssh folder. Next time when we login it will login without password

How do you login remote server
ssh username@servername  or ssh username@privateipaddress

We can also login using pem file
ssh -i pemfile username@servername

ssh-keygen
Used to gererate ssh key(private key and public key) under .ssh folder.
.ssh folder will be created under default path of user.
Default path of root - /root
Default path of ubuntu - /home/ubuntu

SCP
Used to copy file from one server to another server 
File : scp /home/ubuntu/filename root@ipaddress : /home/ubuntu
Dir: scp -r /home/ubuntu/dir name root@ipaddress:/home/ubuntu

Difference between SCP and rsync
While coping data from one server to another server. If copy stop in between due to some network issue, once the system is back . If I use scp command it will start copying from beginning
If I use rsync it will start copying from where it was stopped
